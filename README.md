# School_District_Analysis
### Overview/Purpose:
The purpose of the challenge is to help Maria, a data analyst, prepare all standrized test data for the school district. This will provide insides about performance,trends, and patterns, which will later be used for informed discussiones and strategic decicions at the school and district levels.

We will help Maria analyze data on student's funding and studend's standarized test scores. Our task is to aggregate the data and showcase trends in school performance. This analysis will help the school board on making decisions regarding the school budget.In order to do this analysis, we will install Anaconda, create a PythonData enviroment and use Jupyter notebook.

After Maria was finished with the analysis, she was informed that there was evidence of academic dishonesty and the math and reading scores of nineth graders at Thomas High School have been altered. She was tasked with redoing the analysis and replacing the reading and math scores of the nineth graders with NaN and see how this affected the overall results.

# Results: 
### How is the district summary affected?
The overall impact that Thomas High School had to the district was not significant. 

### How is the school summary affected?

### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade
Scores by school spending
Scores by school size
Scores by school type

# Summary:
### Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
